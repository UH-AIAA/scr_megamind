#  Coding standard AIAA:

  -  Branch name: Ex: BMP581-Issue#1
  -  camelCase() function name
  -  m_memberVariables
  -  Comment on code
  -  Write as few line as possible
  -  Avoid Deep nesting (avoid double loop function that increases time complexity)
  -  Avoid long lines
  -  Explicit naming (no i,j,etc... Ex: time)
  -  Unit test code (TBD)
  -  ReadMe for your code
  -  Error handling. Print out to serial monitor sensor/state error
  -  Automate if necessary
